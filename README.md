# CrackIPN
Pavement crack dataset

CrackIPN is created as a challenging database in Mexico City, consist of 400 RGB images of 320x480 pixel size, which contain the most frequent noises presented in real environments such as: oil stains, shadows, vegetation, zebra steps, etc. The cracked pavement images were manually segmented representing the most valuables cracks. This dataset presents a series of cracks that go from simple forms such as a single crack in a horizontal form, to cracks with different intersections and junctions, covered with vegetation or in different illumination condition due to shadows and pavement color.
